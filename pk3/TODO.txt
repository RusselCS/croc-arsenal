TODO:
- Energy Balancer: Innate + Energy Balancer Neo
- Commando Bomb: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Thunder Bolt: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Dust Crusher: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Freeze Cracker: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Explosive weapons: DONTREFLECT sweep
- Power Stone: Altfire to reverse direction
- Water Shield: I don't like how the damage is currently handled, because the change is arbitrary-feeling.
- Chill Spike: I've heard reports that it is possible to "permafreeze" players.
- Wind Storm: Increase pull a bit
- Rush Coil: Activation radius larger than give radius
- Copy Vision: Needs an over-health meter
- Copy Vision: Give predictive homing
- Copy Vision: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Llama's suggestion is make it wider with a wavebeam-like shot.
- Break Dash: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Thinking either a short-range punch using Pluto's "claw shot" graphic, or the weird homing energy blast.
- Flash Bomb: Needs nerfs
- Mirror Buster: Needs nerfs or is inherently broken.
- Homing Sniper: Very strong, unsure if nerfs needed.
- Gyro Attack: On the strong side, though not overbearing?
- Photon Missile: Very strong, allegedly completely oppressive.
- Black Hole Bomb: Do something. Possible make it do what it does faster? (Suck in then explode quickly)
- Bass Buster: Implement v6c changes.
- Flame Sword: Composite hitbox to make each segment hit for more damage total. (Maybe a max of 60? 70?) [need input from team.]
- Skull Barrier: [needs input from team.]

DONE:
- Reaim Tracer: -ACTIVATEIMPACT
- Remote Mine: Has a tendency to aim behind a fleeing player.
- Noise Crush: Catching has become less reliable after animation changes
- Crash Bomb: Give a delay when a player is struck. Do not add the "can transfer to enemy" bit from Smash.
- Pharaoh Shot: Implement Gibus's midcharge explosion version. Reduces uncharged damage, smooths some animations, tweak charge times.
