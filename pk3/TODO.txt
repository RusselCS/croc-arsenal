===== TODO =====
Visual changes:
- Gravity Hold: Stretch lines vertically to change the visual effect
- Astro Crush: Activation sound
- Time Slow: Horizontal/3D graphic
- Thunder Beam: Additional effects?
- Gemini Laser: Update bounce particle to use the one from NGPC
- Spark Shock: Shocked effect should not be in player face, or it should be less painful.

Reworks:
- Power Stone: Altfire to reverse direction
- Black Hole Bomb: Do something. Possible make it do what it does faster? (Suck in then explode quickly)
- Bass Buster: Implement v6c changes.
- Skull Barrier: [needs input from team.]
- Knight Crush: Reaim Mechanic
- Super Arm: That low ceiling mechanic feels real bad
- Tornado Blow: Minimum falling speed on both damage and use
- Fire Storm: Explode on landing, reduce damage of shield explosion
- Search Snake: Use CBM version.
- Ice Wave: Use CBM search snake to merge into.
- Sakugarne: Make it easier to deselect while active (it tends to enter a "waiting" state that's real annoying)
- Shadow Blade: Bounce + rippercap
- Hyper Bomb: Maybe make easier to explode somehow?
- Scorch Wheel: Split the projectile into separate particles.

Numbers:
- Flash Bomb: Needs nerfs
- Wind Storm: Increase pull a bit
- Mirror Buster: Needs nerfs or is inherently broken.
- Homing Sniper: Very strong, unsure if nerfs needed.
- Gyro Attack: On the strong side, though not overbearing?
- Photon Missile: Very strong, allegedly completely oppressive.
- Water Shield: Make damage consistent, make water orbs orbit faster.
- Silver Tomahawk: Make 3 hit.
- Photon Missile: On release, add half the missing time to the end of the weapon's cycle to discourage spamming.
- Commando Bomb: Possible increase step height of waves?
- Ballade Cracker: Slight buff? Atm it does not feel like it competes with most power weapons, but does not need anything super big. Maybe an ROF bump.
- Blizzard Attack: This definitely does not need to deal as much damage as it does.
- Water Balloon: Investigate its power level and maybe give it a buff?
- Atomic Fire: fucked up damage on midcharge

Tech updates:
- Crystal Eye: Use composite hitbox to handle splits to cap its hits
- Tornado Hold: Use composite hitbox to handle the "occasional damage" mechanic. Also look into animation and sound accuracy
- Oil Slider activate sound jump sound on air jump
- Sweep: A_JumpIfInventory("MM8BDMPlayer", 1, "State", AAPTR_TRACER) -> A_JumpIf(IsPointerEqual(AAPTR_TRACER, AAPTR_NULL), "State")
- Explosive weapons: DONTREFLECT sweep

Defects:
- Chill Spike: Give an "immunity" time to Chill Spike's freeze that lasts a 1/4th second longer than the freeze itself to keep from permafreezing.

===== DONE =====
- Reaim Tracer: -ACTIVATEIMPACT
- Remote Mine: Has a tendency to aim behind a fleeing player.
- Noise Crush: Catching has become less reliable after animation changes
- Crash Bomb: Give a delay when a player is struck. Do not add the "can transfer to enemy" bit from Smash.
- Pharaoh Shot: Implement Gibus's midcharge explosion version. Reduces uncharged damage, smooths some animations, tweak charge times.
- Copy Vision: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Llama's suggestion is make it wider with a wavebeam-like shot.
- Copy Vision: Give predictive homing
- Copy Vision: Needs an over-health meter
- Flame Sword: Composite hitbox to make each segment hit for more damage total. First hit is big, subsequent hits are small, up to X number of hits.
- Commando Bomb: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Thunder Bolt: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Dust Crusher: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Freeze Cracker: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Energy Balancer: Innate + Energy Balancer Neo
- Rush Coil: Activation radius larger than give radius
- Break Dash: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Thinking either a short-range punch using Pluto's "claw shot" graphic, or the weird homing energy blast.
