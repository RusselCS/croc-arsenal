===== TODO =====
Reworks:
- Power Stone: Altfire to reverse direction
- Black Hole Bomb: Do something. Possible make it do what it does faster? (Suck in then explode quickly)
- Bass Buster: Implement v6c changes.
- Skull Barrier: [needs input from team.]

Numbers:
- Flash Bomb: Needs nerfs
- Wind Storm: Increase pull a bit
- Mirror Buster: Needs nerfs or is inherently broken.
- Homing Sniper: Very strong, unsure if nerfs needed.
- Gyro Attack: On the strong side, though not overbearing?
- Photon Missile: Very strong, allegedly completely oppressive.
- Water Shield: I don't like how the damage is currently handled, because the change is arbitrary-feeling.
- Silver Tomahawk: Make 3 hit.

Tech updates:
- Crystal Eye: Use composite hitbox to handle splits to cap its hits
- Sweep: A_JumpIfInventory("MM8BDMPlayer", 1, "State", AAPTR_TRACER) -> A_JumpIf(IsPointerEqual(AAPTR_TRACER, AAPTR_NULL), "State")
- Explosive weapons: DONTREFLECT sweep

Defects:
- Chill Spike: Give an "immunity" time to Chill Spike's freeze that lasts a 1/4th second longer than the freeze itself to keep from permafreezing.

===== DONE =====
- Reaim Tracer: -ACTIVATEIMPACT
- Remote Mine: Has a tendency to aim behind a fleeing player.
- Noise Crush: Catching has become less reliable after animation changes
- Crash Bomb: Give a delay when a player is struck. Do not add the "can transfer to enemy" bit from Smash.
- Pharaoh Shot: Implement Gibus's midcharge explosion version. Reduces uncharged damage, smooths some animations, tweak charge times.
- Copy Vision: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Llama's suggestion is make it wider with a wavebeam-like shot.
- Copy Vision: Give predictive homing
- Copy Vision: Needs an over-health meter
- Flame Sword: Composite hitbox to make each segment hit for more damage total. First hit is big, subsequent hits are small, up to X number of hits.
- Commando Bomb: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Thunder Bolt: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Dust Crusher: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Freeze Cracker: Give Composite Hitbox to limit damage output
- Energy Balancer: Innate + Energy Balancer Neo
- Rush Coil: Activation radius larger than give radius
- Break Dash: Change "uncharged" shot in a functional way. Thinking either a short-range punch using Pluto's "claw shot" graphic, or the weird homing energy blast.
